This directory contains various patches to some version of the
original Purkinje cell tutorial.  Perhaps they can't be applied
anymore perhaps they can.  The original versions that were used to
create the patch are implied in the filename.  The last part of the
filename gives some clue about the function change in the patch
(e.g. the AnyChanMode patch runs the model with hsolve in any chanmode
or even without hsolve).

Take a look at the different scripts/patches and see if you can use
them one way or the other.  No support will be given for any of the
patches in this directory.


A patch is typically applied with ('$' being the shell prompt)

$ patch <'filename.patch' -p1


To remove a successfully applied patch

$ patch <'filename.patch' -p1 -R
