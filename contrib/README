This directory contains various files with contributions from other
people.  Take a look at the different scripts and see if you can use
them one way or the other.  If you use one of the contrib scripts, you
are on your own : perhaps they have been tested with an other version
of the Purkinje cell tutorial, they can be misbehaving.  No support
will be given for the scripts in these directories.
